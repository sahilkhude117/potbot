## Description

**PotBot** transforms Telegram group chats into collaborative, decentralized investment vehicles. It allows groups of friends, traders, or communities to pool capital into a shared "pot" where designated traders can execute trades programmatically through Telegram commands‚Äîall secured by Solana smart contracts.

Whether you're running a degen trading group, testing investment strategies with friends, or exploring DeFi as a community, PotBot gives you the tools to trade collectively while maintaining full transparency and on-chain security.

**Target Users:**
- Crypto trading communities and Telegram groups
- Friends pooling money for collaborative trading
- Influencers running copy-trading groups
- DeFi enthusiasts exploring group fund management

## Key Features

### **Group Trading (Collective Pots)**
- **Pooled Capital**: Group members contribute SOL to a shared pot managed collectively
- **Permissioned Traders**: Only designated traders can execute trades on behalf of the group
- **Instant Withdrawals**: Members can withdraw their proportional share anytime
- **Share-Based System**: Fair capital distribution based on deposit shares
- **Transparent Tracking**: View group portfolio, recent trades, and transactions

### **Copy Trading (Private DMs)**
- **Automated Mirror Trading**: Automatically replicate trades from successful wallets
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: 30-second polling for new transactions via **Zerion API**
- **Trade Filtering**: Only copies confirmed "trade" type transactions
- **Private & Secure**: Works exclusively in private DMs with the bot
- **Status Tracking**: View copied trades, success rate, and recent activity
- **Powered by Zerion**: Leverages Zerion API for real-time transaction monitoring and trade detection

### **Personal Trading**
- **Buy/Sell Tokens**: Execute Jupiter swaps directly through Telegram
- **Wallet Management**: Each user gets a Solana wallet managed by the bot
- **Balance Tracking**: Check SOL balance and token holdings
- **Private Key Access**: Export your private key for external wallet use
- **Portfolio View**: See your positions, recent trades, and transactions powered by **Zerion API**
- **Real-Time Pricing**: Accurate token prices and portfolio valuation via Zerion integration

### **Security & Smart Contracts**
- **On-Chain Logic**: All pot operations secured by Anchor smart contracts
- **Solana Program**: Deployed at `636NmFV9Nhr2TV49RyjJUp2kyBVbnZFMmPqQjvHeJNzU`
- **Trader Permissions**: Add/remove traders via on-chain instructions
- **Performance & Redemption Fees**: Configurable fee structure per pot
- **Swap Delegation**: Traders use delegated authority for secure swaps

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Note**: The smart contract is currently deployed on Solana Devnet. As Jupiter swaps are not available on Devnet (as per recommendations from Superteam member (Shek)), we have implemented a simplified off-chain approach using separate vault wallets instead of PDAs for demonstration purposes. The complete smart contract infrastructure is production-ready and will be deployed on Mainnet following a security audit.

## How It Works

### **Creating and Managing Pots**

1. **Create a Pot**
   - User clicks "Create Pot" in private DM with the bot
   - Bot generates a unique pot wallet and seed on Solana
   - Admin creates a Telegram group and adds the bot
   - Bot automatically links the group to the pot

2. **Add Members**
   - Admin generates an invite link through the bot
   - New members click the invite link and join the group
   - Members can deposit SOL to receive proportional shares

3. **Set Traders**
   - Admin uses `/settrader <wallet_address>` to grant trading permissions
   - Traders can buy/sell tokens using group funds via Jupiter swaps
   - Admin can remove traders with `/removetrader <wallet_address>`

4. **Trading**
   - Traders execute buy/sell commands in the group chat
   - Bot routes trades through Jupiter aggregator for best prices
   - All trades are recorded on-chain and in the database
   - Group can view portfolio and trade history anytime

5. **Withdrawals**
   - Members can withdraw their share of the pot at any time
   - Bot calculates proportional value across all assets
   - If necessary, assets are swapped to SOL via Jupiter
   - SOL is transferred to the user's wallet

### **Copy Trading Flow**

1. User starts copy trading via `/copytrade` command in private DM
2. User enters the Solana wallet address to copy
3. Bot monitors the target wallet every 30 seconds via **Zerion API**
4. When a trade is detected (via Zerion's transaction feed), bot replicates it using Jupiter swaps
5. User can check status with `/copytradestatus` or stop with `/stopcopytrade`

> **üí° Zerion Integration**: Copy trading is powered by Zerion API, which provides real-time transaction monitoring, trade detection, and portfolio tracking across Solana wallets. This enables accurate trade replication and portfolio analysis.
