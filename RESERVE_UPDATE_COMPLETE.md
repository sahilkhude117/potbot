# ✅ SOL Reserve Implementation Complete - All Wizards Updated

## Summary of Changes

All wizards now use centralized constants from `src/lib/constants.ts` and provide detailed error messages showing users exactly how much they can withdraw/spend/deposit.

---

## 📦 Constants Centralized

**File**: `src/lib/constants.ts`

```typescript
export const MINIMUM_SOL_RESERVE = 0.005;
export const MINIMUM_SOL_RESERVE_LAMPORTS = Math.floor(MINIMUM_SOL_RESERVE * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
export const SOL_MINT = "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112";
export const TRADE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Centralized Constants**
- All magic numbers replaced with named constants
- Easy to maintain and update in one place
- Consistent across entire codebase

### 2. **Better User Experience**
All error messages now show:
- ✅ Current balance (total)
- ✅ Reserved amount (with explanation)
- ✅ Available amount (what they can actually use)
- ✅ Maximum they can withdraw/spend/deposit
- ✅ Clear explanation of why reserve is needed

### 3. **Smart Calculations**
- Uses `Math.max(0, balance - reserve)` to prevent negative values
- Withdrawal wizard shows **exactly** how much is withdrawable
- All wizards calculate maximum allowed amount

### 4. **Consistent Reserve Logic**
| Feature | Reserve Location | Amount | Purpose |
|---------|-----------------|--------|---------|
| User Deposit | User Wallet | 0.005 SOL | Keep SOL for future txs |
| Personal Buy | User Wallet | 0.005 SOL | Keep SOL for fees |
| Pot Buy | Pot Wallet | 0.005 SOL | Keep SOL for pot operations |
| Pot Withdrawal | Pot Wallet | 0.005 SOL | Rent + transaction fees |
